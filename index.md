# Detailed Bioinformatics pipelines for Short- and Long-read sequences with Kraken2

*- Funded by [European COST Action](https://www.cost.eu) and [EuroMIC](https://www.euro-mic.org)*

### Summary

This guide outlines how Short- and Long-read sequences can be analysed using a custom pipeline
to assess data from 16S rRNA sequencing of microbial communities associated with MIC
(Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion). 

It is designed to be accessible to readers with limited
technical expertise, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding. Terminal commands and their
parameters will be explained objectively. When applicable, other, openly available tools that are suited
for the task, is listed as an alternative option.

### Pre-requisites

- Workstation with at least ***4 CPU Cores***, ***16GB RAM*** and ***75GB of free space*** (8+ Cores, 32GB+ RAM and 150GB free space recommended).
- Basic understanding of CLI (Command Line Interface) to use the listed tools
- *Optional*: Knowledge of Bash or other scripting/programming language (Python, R, etc.)
